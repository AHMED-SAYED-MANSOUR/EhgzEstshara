   <b> 1-Rotator Cuff tears .</b>
    The rotator cuff is made up of muscles and four tendons that surround the shoulder joint. Whether from a direct blow or from repetitive motion over time,
     injuries to the rotator cuff cause the tendons to tear and become damaged.
     Causes of a Rotator Cuff Tear
A rotator cuff injury may be caused by:
• A direct blow to the shoulder
• Repetitive overhead motion of the arm, as in swimming, baseball, or tennis
• Chronic degenerative wear and tear on the tendons
• Falling on an outstretched arm
<br>

<b>
2- Bone Fracture.
</b>
A fracture is a broken bone. It can be anything from a small crack to a bone that has separated and moves out of place.
Bone fracture symptoms include:
• Sharp pain.
• Swelling.
• Bruising.
Doctors can often treat bone fractures with a cast or splint. Severe breaks may need surgery.
Fractures are one of the most common injuries to bones. A Lancet study found that there are about 178 million fractures a year worldwide. About 18.3 million of those are in the U.S., according to the U.S. Bone and Joint Initiative.
By the time they're 65, about half of all Americans will have broken a bone. These fractures range in severity and treatment. Broken Bone and Fracture Symptoms and Diagnosis
Fractures and breaks aren't always plain to see.
For instance, if you break a bone in your arm, the cracked bone may be sore but not look broken.

<b>
3-Labral Tear.
</b>
Our shoulders and hips are ball-and-socket joints. The top — or "ball" — of the shoulder or hipbone fits into a socket, allowing for range of motion.
The labrum is a ring of cartilage that follows the outside rim of the shoulder and hip sockets. It keeps the ball of the bone in the socket and provides smooth and painless shoulder or hip motion.
A labral tear occurs when you damage the labrum in the shoulder or hip.
Labral tear causes
Labral tears to the shoulder damage the ring of cartilage surrounding the shoulder socket.
Common causes of labral tears in the shoulder include:
• Trauma, such as a fracture or dislocated shoulder (https://www.upmc.com/services/sports-medicine/conditions/shoulder-dislocation). (https://www.upmc.com/services/sports-medicine/conditions/shoulder-dislocation)
• Overuse.
• Repetitive motion.
The hip joint includes the head of the femur (known as the ball) and the acetabulum (the socket) of the pelvis.
The most common cause of labral tears in the hip is an external force to a hyperextended, externally rotated hip.

<b>
4- Bursitis.
</b>
Doctors define trochanteric bursitis as an inflammation in the sac of fluid (bursa) that surrounds the outside bone, or trochanter, of your hip. The lower outside part of your hip will hurt, and moving hurts. Lying on the hip will cause pain, as will pressure on the area. Trochanteric bursitis of the hips symptoms make transitioning from sitting to standing, or climbing stairs, challenging.
Trochanteric bursitis affects about 15% of women and 8% of men. It most commonly happens in middle-aged women. However, female athletes of all ages can have this type of bursitis.

     <br>
<b>
5-Dislocated Shoulder.
</b>
A dislocated shoulder occurs when the top of the bone of your upper arm (humerus) comes out of the socket in your shoulder (scapula). This can be a partial or complete dislocation.
• A partial shoulder dislocation means that the bone has gone back into the scapula on its own.
• A complete shoulder dislocation means the bone has not gone back into the proper place, and requires medical attention. You should not try to force the bone back into the scapula yourself.

    <h1>Prevenetion</h1>
    <p>
        <b>1-Rotator Cuff Tear Prevention</b>
        Athletes in sports that use a lot of repetitive overhead arm motion are at a higher risk of getting a rotator cuff injury. People over age 40, people who do a lot of heavy lifting, or people with weakened shoulder muscles from inactivity are also at higher risk.
        To help prevent tearing the rotator cuff, avoid heavy lifting and try to give your arm and shoulder a break from repetitive motions. Exercise regularly to keep the muscles around your shoulder joint strong.
        <br>
        <b>2-bone fracture prevention</b>
        Many shoulder fractures and injuries result from accidents that often cannot be prevented. However,
        regular exercise and stretching can improve strength and flexibility in the shoulder to help reduce the risk of injury.
        <br>
        <b>3-lebral tear prevention</b>
        Athletes at an increased risk for labral tears are those that play sports involving repetitive movement of the shoulder or hip, such as:
       • Golf
       • Baseball
       • Tennis
       Other labral tear risk factors include a traumatic injury or a degenerative condition, like osteoarthritis.
       <br>
       <b>4-Bursitis prevention</b>
       Warm up before exercising or before sports or other repetitive movements.
       Start new exercises or sports slowly. Gradually increase the demands you put on your body.
       <br>
       <b>5-Dislocated Shoulder prevention</b>
       A dislocated shoulder can result from a variety of situations that involve impact to the shoulder.
       Common causes of dislocated shoulders include:
       • Any hard fall onto the shoulder.
       • Forceful hitting, lifting, or throwing.
       • A hit to an outstretched arm.
       Athletes at risk of shoulder dislocations include:
       • Football players
       • Hockey players

<div id="diagnosis">
    <h1>Symptoms and diagnosis</h1>
 <p>
  <b>1-Rotator cuff tears symptoms and diagnosis</b>
  Rotator cuff tear symptoms include:
  Difficulty, pain and weakness caused by raising, lowering or rotating your arm.
  Popping, clicking or crackling sounds or sensations when moving your arm in certain positions.
  Shoulder pain that worsens at night or when resting your arm.
  Shoulder weakness and struggling to lift items.
  <br>
  <b>2- Bone Fracture symptoms and diagnosis</b>
  <b>
  What are the symptoms of a broken or fractured bone?
  </b>
Some symptoms of a break or fracture include:
• Sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse when you move the bone or with pressure.
• Swelling, bruising, or tenderness at the injury site.
• Not able to put weight on the area.
• The arm or leg bends in an odd way or the bone sticks out through the skin. (If you ever see a bone sticking through the skin, go to the emergency room right away.)
How do you diagnose a broken bone or fracture?
Your doctor will first examine the injured area, assessing symptoms and things like range of motion. Your doctor will also ask questions about your medical history, including if you've broken bones before.
The standard way to diagnose fractures is through X-rays.
X-rays give a clear image of the bone. They can show where the break is and what type of break it is. Doctors who have trained to read X-rays can even spot tiny breaks on an X-ray.
But X-rays don't show soft tissues, like ligaments, tendons, or cartilage. They also can't show blood vessels or nerves. If your doctor thinks you might have other injuries related to the fracture, you may need an MRI.
If you've broken bones before, your doctor may look for clues about whether you have a health problem that causes weak bones.
  <br>
  <b>3-Labral Tear symptoms and diagnosis</b>
  you may feel shoulder pain or experience shoulder instability (the feeling that your shoulder is slipping out of place).
   Labral tears are usually caused by overuse or injury and commonly accompany other injuries to the shoulder.
   <br>
   <b>4-Bursitis symptoms and diagnosis</b>
   <b>
   What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Trochanteric Bursitis?
   </b>
Symptoms of trochanteric bursitis include:
• Pain in the hip when moving the joint.
• Pain when you lie on the affected side of the body.
• Tenderness in the hip.
• Limping.
• Soreness or swelling in the hip.
The pain may spread down your leg toward the knee.
If you've been struggling with hip pain you suspect is bursitis for two weeks, see a sports medicine specialist for an evaluation.
<b>
How Do You Diagnose Trochanteric Bursitis
</b>
A visit to a medical professional can diagnose the bursa inflammation that causes trochanteric bursitis without additional testing. A physical exam combined with a history is usually enough.
As part of the exam, your doctor may ask you to perform a series of range-of-motion activities. This checks how severe your bursitis is. It can also rule out other problems, like a fracture.
However, your doctor may order tests just to make sure there isn't an underlying bone issue. These diagnostic tests can include:
• X-ray
• Bone scan
Though many patients don't need any further diagnostic tests, your doctor may suggest an MRI. This is an advanced imaging test that shows the bursa and soft tissue.
<br>
<b>5-Dislocated shoulder symptoms and diagnosis</b>
<b>
Dislocated shoulder symptoms
</b>
When a shoulder dislocation occurs, the first symptom is an immediate and strong pain.
You may also have other symptoms such as:
• Instability in shoulder.
• Weakness in the shoulder area.
• Inability to move the shoulder.
• Swelling, bruising, numbness, or tingling around the shoulder, or in the arm or fingers.
<b>
Dislocated shoulder diagnosis
</b>
In the event of a partial or complete shoulder dislocation, you should consult a medical expert right away to diagnose the injury.
During the appointment, the doctor will assess your shoulder and symptoms.
He or she may order an imaging test to confirm severity of the shoulder dislocation.
