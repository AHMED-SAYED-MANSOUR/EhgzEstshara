    <h5>Back pain</h5>
 <p>
   <br>
    Types of Back Pain
    Back pain is usually categorized by the area where you feel the pain. The most common type of back pain is in the lower back.
    <b>
    Lower back pain
    </b>
    Lower back pain can happen anywhere below the ribs and above the legs. You can hurt your lower back when you lift, reach, or twist. In fact, almost everyone has low back pain at one time or another.

    Depending on the cause, low back pain can have a range of symptoms. The pain may be dull or sharp. It may be in one small area or over a broad area. You may have muscle spasms.

    Low back pain also can cause leg pain, numbness, or tingling, often extending below the knee.

    Seek emergency treatment if you have weakness or numbness in both legs or if you lose bladder or bowel control.
    <br>
    <b>
    Upper and middle back pain
    </b>
    Upper and middle back pain are less common because the bones in this area of the back don’t flex or move as much as the bones in your lower back or neck.
    Upper and middle back pain can occur anywhere from the base of your neck to the bottom of your rib cage.
    If a nerve in this area is pinched, irritated, or injured, you also may feel pain in other places where the nerve travels, including your arms, legs, chest, and belly.
    <br>
    <b>
    What Causes Back Pain?
    </b>
    “The most common causes of occasional back pain include overuse, strain, or injury to the muscles, ligaments, and discs that support your spine
    Fast movement, repetitive lifting, an awkward bend, or an attempt to lift something beyond your capabilities can cause pain. If you routinely lift and bend, repetitive stress on your lower back can trigger painful muscle spasms
    Additionally, if you’re spending hours at a computer each day — whether at the workplace or at home — poor posture and ergonomics
    (how your desk is set up) can lead to chronic back pain.

    How Can I Reduce Back Pain at Home?

Try to keep moving. Continue light activity, like walking. If your back hurts a lot, take a break. But try not to let too much time pass before you get moving again. Instead, return to activities slowly. Walking is perhaps the simplest and best exercise for the lower back. It gets your blood moving and helps your muscles stay strong.

Try aqua therapy. If land-based exercise is difficult, try moving in a warm pool. The reduced gravity of the water can help build more range of motion in your spine.

Use a heating pad or ice pack. Heat can reduce pain and stiffness. Ice can help reduce pain and swelling. There is no rule about using heat or ice for back pain. Try each to see which works best for you.

Try a gentle yoga/stretch class. Slow, deliberate movement and stretching can build core strength and increase flexibility.

Try manual therapy. Manual therapy is a general term for treatment performed mostly with the hands, including massage, mobilization, and manipulation. The goals of manual therapy include relaxation, decreased pain, and increased flexibility

Do some simple core exercises. Good posture depends on strong abdominal muscles – the opposing muscle group to the low back. Strengthening the core can relieve low back pain. Your doctor or physical therapist can recommend more specific exercises to help your back muscles get stronger. These may include a series of simple exercises for core stabilization. Strengthening the muscles in your trunk or torso can improve your posture,
 keep your body in better balance, and lower your chance of injury

<div id="diagnosis">
    <h1>Symptoms and diagnosis</h1>
 <p>
    Back pain can range from a muscle aching to a shooting, burning or stabbing sensation. Also, the pain can radiate down a leg. Bending, twisting, lifting, standing or walking can make it worse.
    Symptoms of lower back pain can come on suddenly or appear gradually. Sometimes, pain occurs after a specific event, such as bending to pick something up. Other times, you may not know what caused the pain.

    Pain may be sharp or dull and achy, and it may radiate to your bottom or down the back of your legs (sciatica). If you strain your back during an activity, you may hear a “pop” when it happened. Pain is often worse in certain positions (like bending over) and gets better when you lie down.
    <b>
    Other symptoms of lower back pain include:
    </b>
    Stiffness: It may be tough to move or straighten your back. Getting up from a seated position may take a while, and you might feel like you need to walk or stretch to loosen up. You may notice decreased range of motion.
    Posture problems: Many people with back pain find it hard to stand up straight. You may stand “crooked” or bent, with your torso off to the side rather than aligned with your spine. Your lower back may look flat instead of curved.
    Muscle spasms: After a strain, muscles in the lower back can spasm or contract uncontrollably. Muscle spasms can cause extreme pain and make it difficult or impossible to stand, walk or move.
